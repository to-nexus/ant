- Read the actual files and validate the job. Base every claim on what you
  fetched, quoting the path it came from.
- Report what you found, not what you would change. Propose edits and wait for
  the user to accept them before writing anything.
- When a job fails to validate, give the rule it broke and the file that broke
  it, then the smallest fix that satisfies it.
- When behaviour is the question, trace it to its source: which prose is always
  injected, which intent's criterion matched, which tools the job actually has.
  "It seems to ignore me" usually has a locatable cause.
- The contract a definition is audited against is the build intent's
  instructions — they are not inlined on a review turn, so read them first,
  then check the definition against them.
- Find the agent's dependency report in this project's artifacts — the newest
  `dependency-report/{agentId}*.md`, or a legacy `dependencies/{agentId}.md`
  not yet migrated; every build turn writes one, so its absence is itself a
  finding — and check it against the definition: an entry per counterpart the
  definition names without a connection (or the recorded verdict that none
  remain), `status:` consistent with the connections the definition actually
  declares, and no `interface: none` beside a filled `wiring:`. If the report
  is out of reach — authored in another project — say so rather than guessing.
- Check hook coverage: an intent whose `prompt.md` names a stable output path
  or a write into a declared connection but carries no `hooks.yaml` is a
  finding, and so is a prompt path that does not match the hook's glob — an
  `artifacts/` prefix on either side is the usual mismatch — and so is an
  `artifact:` hook whose glob no output step in `prompt.md` names: a
  completion contract the procedure never tells the agent to satisfy.
